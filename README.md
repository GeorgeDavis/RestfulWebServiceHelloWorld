# RestfulWebServiceHelloWorld

This project is for learning RESTful Web Services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. 
The concept of Representational State Transfer can be difficult to understand at first, but with work you will come to see how powerful REST Web
Services can be. State transfer speaks to stateless protocol. Stateless protocol does not require the operating server to maintain session information 
about the contacting client for the duration of the meeting. RESTful web services are interoperable, meaning one service developed in a java platform can communicate 
with a web service developed in a .net platform. 
RESTful webservices were built on top of the original idea of Internet Protocol (IP) and Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Request. Mainly GET, POST, UPDATE, and DELETE request.

As a new developer myself, it helps me to relay what I know and have learned to others so that I may have a greater understanding as well. 

This is a Spring-Boot starter application, that utilizes Spring Initializr to create the project. Dependencies include: 
Web, Devtools, JPA, and h2

Spring Initializr includes a pom.xml that can be found in the root directory.

There are two main controllers in the project. One is for HelloWorld, the other	is for a User named UserResource (Controllers are commonly known as Resources due to the Resource class being exposed in the URL).
